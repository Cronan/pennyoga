  intro: >
    I qualified as a British Wheel of Yoga teacher in 2004, and was a yoga
    student for ten years before that. I've been running my friendly, nurturing
    and relaxed classes in Berkhamsted and Hemel Hempstead since then.

about:
  heading: "About Penny Cronyn"
  quote: "A sense of equilibrium and equanimity"
  intro: >
    The first yoga class I attended was in a church hall in the mid 1990s.
    The teacher was in her 60s, with amazing strength and mobility. I was in
    a class filled with yoga students several decades older than me. They all
    had better levels of flexibility, focus and balance than I did. Each
    session ended with tea and cake served to all the students; a bygone age.
    Those students have served as an inspiration to me ever since. I've also
    discovered that yoga is an excellent companion to many other forms of
    exercise. Most of all, it is the sense of equilibrium and equanimity that
    I experience at the end of a good yoga practice that keeps me returning.
  training: >
    In 2002 I decided to train as a British Wheel of Yoga (BWY) teacher.
    Thanks to the high standards and generous, warm-hearted support of
    inspirational teachers like Sarah Davey, Marlyn Miles, Kay Luckman and
    Monica Burton, I qualified as a BWY-accredited teacher in 2004.
